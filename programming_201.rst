Python
======
Python is one of the most versatile languages you're going to use in your career.
You will soon see that for almost everything you want to do, Python either has a something in its standard library or an amazing third-party module that you can import in seconds.
But since this is a guide for operations engineers, I'll focus the discussion more towards Python's scripting capabilities.

NOTE: Before I start, I want to point out a series of documents called Python Enhancement Proposals, PEP for short.
Like their title suggests, these are potential enhancements to the Python language that have been proposed by members of the community.
There's a lot of them, and you don't have to go over every single one, but you can find some very useful tips and best-practices there.

Syntax
------
* Indentation

If you've ever written or read any code in C, C++, Java or C#, you're used to seeing curly braces (``{}``) pretty much everywhere.
These compiled languages use curly braces to denote the start and end of functions, loops and conditional statements.
Python, on the other hand, uses indentation to achieve the same goal. What this means is that where you see this in C++:

.. code-block:: cpp

  if (3>2) {
      // Do something
  }

You will see this for Python:

.. code-block:: python

  if (3>2):
      # Do something 

As you can see, Python didn't need curly braces to signify the start or end of the if conditional; a simple indent does the job.
Now when it comes to indentation, PEP8 says that you should use 4 spaces to indent your code.
Keep in mind that this specifically means spaces and not tabs.
Fortunately for you, most text editors today can automatically convert tabs to spaces so you don't have to hit four spaces every time you want to indent a line.
However, if you are dealing with some legacy code that uses 8 space tabs, feel free to continue doing so.

Indentation is by far the most important part of python's syntax you should keep track of.
If there's two lines in your code where one uses 4 spaces and another uses one 4-space tab, Python's going to give you errors when you try to run your script.
Be consistent with your indentation.

* Conditionals

Conditionals refer to ``if, else`` statements where you're checking if some condition is met and then taking action based on whether it is or not.
Python supports conditionals just like any other language, with the only exception being indentation as explained above.
A complete conditional block would look like this:

.. code-block:: python

  # Check if the variable 'num' is greater than or less than 5
  if (num > 5):
      print "Greater"
  else:
    print "Less"

You can even have 'else if' conditions, which in Python are used as ``elif``

.. code-block:: python

  # Check if the variable 'num' is 2 or 5
  if (num == 2):
      print "Number is 2"
  elif (num == 5):
      print "Number is 5"
  else:
      print "Number is neither 2 nor 5"

* Boolean Operations

Python can perform all of the standard boolean operations:``and``, ``or`` and ``not``.
The operations can be used as statements of their own:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> (3 > 2) and (3 < 4)
  True
  >>> (2 > 3) or (3 > 4)
  False
  >>> not (2 > 3)
  True

and even in conditionals:

.. code-block:: python

  if not ((2 < 3) or (3 > 4)):
      print "Neither statment is true"

Variables
---------
Variables in Python work just like in any other language.
They can be assigned values like this:

.. code-block:: python

  times = 4
  name = "John"

They can be used in almost any statement.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> print times
  4
  >>> times + times
  8

You might have noticed that the variable didn't have to be created with a specific type before being assigned a value.
Python allows you to assign any value to a variable and will automatically infer the type based on the value it is assigned.
This means that the value assigned to a variable can be replaced with another value of a completely different type without any issues.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> times = 4
  >>> print times
  4
  >>> times = "Me"
  >>> print times
  'Me'

However, if you try to perform an operation with two variables that have values of conflicting types, the interpreter will throw an error.
Take this example where I will try to add a number and a string.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> times = 4
  >>> name = "John"
  >>> times + name
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

As you can see here, the interpreter threw a TypeError when we tried to add an integer and a string.
But there is a way around this; Python lets you type cast variables so their values can be treated as a different type.
So in the same example, I can either try to treat the variable ``times`` as a string, or the variable ``name`` as an integer.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> str(times) + name
  '4John'
  >>> times + int(name)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'John'

Here you can see that when we cast ``times`` as a string and added it to name, Python concatenated the two strings and gave you the result.
But trying to cast ``name`` as an integer threw a ValueError because 'John' doesn't have a valid base 10 representation.
Remember, almost any type can be represented as a string, but not every string has a valid representation in another type.

Common data structures
----------------------
Out of the box, Python implements a few major data structures.

* Lists

Lists in Python are the equivalent of arrays in other languages you may be familiar with.
They are mutable collections of data that you can append to, remove from and whose elements you can iterate over.
Here's some common operations you can perform with lists:

.. code-block:: python
  
  >>> to_print = [1, 4]
  >>> to_print.append('Hello')
  >>> to_print.append('Hey')
  >>> to_print
  [1, 4, 'Hello', 'Hey']
  >>> for i in to_print:
  ...     print i
  ...
  1
  4
  Hello
  Hey
  >>> to_print[1]
  4
  >>> to_print[-1]
  'Hey'
  >>> to_print[-2:]
  ['Hello', 'Hey']
  >>> to_print.remove(4)
  >>> to_print
  [1, 'Hello', 'Hey']
  
Just like arrays in other languages, Python's lists are zero-indexed and also support negative indexing.
You can use the ``:`` to get a range of items from the list.
When I ran ``to_print[-2:]``, Python returned all items from the second last element to the end.

You may have also noticed that I had both numbers and strings in the list.
Python doesn't care about what kind of elements you throw onto a list.
You can even store lists in lists, effectively making a 2-dimensional matrix since each element of the initial list will be another list.

* Dictionary

Dictionaries are a key-value store which Python implements by default.
Unlike lists, dictionaries can have non-integer keys.
Items of a list can only be referenced by their index in the list, whereas in dictionaries you can define your own keys which will then serve as the reference for the value you assign to it.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> fruit_colours = {}
  >>> fruit_colours['mango'] = 'Yellow'
  >>> fruit_colours['orange'] = 'Orange'
  >>> fruit_colours
  {'orange': 'Orange', 'mango': 'Yellow'}
  >>> fruit_colours['apple'] = ['Red', 'Green']
  {'orange': 'Orange', 'mango': 'Yellow', 'apple': ['Red', 'Green']}
  >>> fruit_colours['mango']
  'Yellow'
  >>> for i in fruit_colours:
  ...     print i
  ...
  orange
  mango
  apple
  >>> for i in fruit_colours:
  ...     print fruit_colours[i]
  ...
  Orange
  Yellow
  ['Red', 'Green']
  
You should be able to see now that dictionaries can take on custom keys.
In this example, my keys were names of fruits, and the value for each key was the colour of that particular fruit.
Dictionaries also don't care about what type your keys or values are, or whether the type of a key matches the type of its value.
This lets us store lists as values, as you saw with the colour of apples, which could be red and green.

An interesting property about dictionaries that you might have noticed, is that iterating through the dictionary returned only the keys in the dictionary.
To see each value, you need to print the corresponding value for the key by calling ``fruit_colours[i]`` inside the for loop where ``i`` takes on the value of a key in the dictionary.

  
Python implements a lot more data structures like tuples, sets and dequeues.
Check out the Python docs for more information these: http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html


Functions
---------
Functions in Python work exactly like they do in other languages.
Each function takes input arguments and returns a value.
The only difference is syntax, you define functions with the keyword ``def``, and don't use cruly braces like in Java, C, C++ and C#.
Instead, function blocks are separated using indentation.

.. code-block:: python

>>> def square(x):
...     result = x*x
...     return result
...
>>> square(3)
9


You can even call functions within other functions

.. code-block:: python

>>> def greet(name):
...     greeting = "Hello "+name+"!"
...     return greeting
...
>>> def new_user(first_name):
...     user = first_name
...     print "New User: "+user
...     print greet(user)
...
>>> new_user('Jack')
New User: Jack
Hello Jack!
