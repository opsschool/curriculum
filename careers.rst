Careers in operations
*********************

Introduction
============

Taking a step into the world of Operations can be daunting. At present there are few
professional degrees, and the ones that exist focus on specialised topics such
as systems administration, network engineering or security.

However, the Operations landscape is significantly larger than that. This page
aims to provide a detailed view on the careers you can move to as you enter the
field.

Deciding a career path
======================

Around the end of the 101 level of Ops School, you will want to start thinking
about which career path you want to take. The paths tend to overlap in places,
and both paths can lead to similar places down the road.

Imagine two roads that run straight, and occasionally get close or overlap, but
generally head in the same direction.

Your two options are usually:

* Operations generalist
* Operations specialist

The one you choose, should be the one you feel most comfortable with. Over time,
as your skills grow, both paths should lead to similar opportunities: team
leadership, senior technical leadership, and management.

The way you travel each path is considerably different, and it isn't uncommon to
switch from one path to another once or twice.

Generalised career paths
========================

Persons in generalised careers are often in high demands by employers.
While the adage states "Jack of all trades, master of none", an operations
generalist is very much expected to be *"Master of almost all trades."*

It's quite common to see a good Operations Engineer who is well versed in
systems administration, database administration, storage engineering, network
engineering, security engineering, and other topics.

Similarly, Operations managers are expected to know a wide variety of subjects
at a reasonable enough level to make good technical decisions. Often, people who
choose to become Operations managers begin their careers as either generalists,
or specialists in one or more fields.

Generalist roles are often most highly prized in technical companies and
startups, where it is beneficial to be able to work with multiple technologies
and groups well.

Specialised career paths

Unlike generalists, specialists are often hired to take care of certain
components of larger systems. While generalists tend to focus on increasing both
the breadth and depth of their knowledge over time, specialists work to become
deep subject matter experts. Common areas of focus are databases, networking,
security, storage, capacity planning, project management, training, and more.
In almost all cases these require at least the 101 level of understanding, and
fully understanding through the 201 level is better.

Systems Administrator
---------------------

The Systems Administrator is the classic and probably most recognised
Operations role. Key responsibilities usually include managing desktops,
servers, operating systems, databases, middle ware and applications.

Systems Administrators can range from "jack of all trades" with knowledge of
multiple systems and platforms to specialists who focus on one system or
platform, for example Microsoft Windows or Linux. 

Whilst perhaps more "general" that some of the other specialist roles, Systems
Administrators tend to focus on managing individual hosts, usually desktops or
servers, rather than looking more broadly at infrastructure like Operations
generalists.

Database Administrator
----------------------

Database Administrators, or DBAs, are specialists in managing the performance,
security and stability of database systems. Once a common role, they are less
frequently seen today and much of the work involved in this role has been
replaced by more advanced database systems, automation and the up skilling of
related roles.

DBAs usually have specialised skills in managing the performance of database
systems, are often experts in understanding database features like stored
procedures and are called upon to improve the performance of database systems
using techniques like query analysis.

Network Engineer
----------------

Network Engineers are Operations people who focus on network devices and
network management. Network Engineers manage the provisioning, configuration,
security and availability of networking infrastructure.

Security Engineer
-----------------

Whilst seen by many as a separate discipline, Security Engineers are Operations
people with a focus on security and security technology. Security Engineering
roles can include:

* Traditional Systems Administrators who maintain security equipment like firewalls and proxies,
* Specialists who design and manage complex cryptographic systems,
* Penetration testers who attempt to identify security vulnerabilities in infrastructure and applications,
* Engineers with a focus on Identity Management who manage complex authorisation, access control and authentication systems, and
* Analysts and incident response personnel who respond to security events and incidents

Security Engineers usually have many of the same skills as their more
mainstream Operations colleagues but often include deeper skills in fields such
as Compliance Management (ensuring companies maintain compliance to industry
and government regulations), Risk Management (identifying, documenting and
managing Risk), education (teaching people about how to stay secure),
Cryptography, and related areas.

Storage Engineer
----------------

Seen largely in enterprise-scale organisations, Storage Engineers focus on
managing storage technologies such as disk arrays, Network Attached Storage
(NAS) devices, Storage Area Networks (SANs), Tape and Media management systems
and related backup technologies.

They usually have strong skill overlaps with Network Engineers (with so much
modern storage being network-attached in some manner) and usually have strong
skills in capacity planning and performance management of infrastructure.
