Soft Skills
***********

The term soft skills seems to imply that these skills are somehow less
important than technical skills. In reality, soft skills often separate
the technical-level operations person from the senior engineer. Soft
skills encompass general business acuity, communications skills, time
management, project management, and people management. General
business skills include positioning, understanding of organizational
finances, risk management, managing customer preference, and thinking
strategically.

Communication
=============

Communication 101 would tell you that the first step to effective
communication is audience analysis. A basic audience analysis consists
of answering some simple questions:

* Is your audience technical or non-technical?
* How much do they know about the topic you are trying to communicate?
* How much do they care about the topic?
* What communication mechanism will work best to deliver your message: face-to-face meeting or class, email, social media, internal poster or bulletin board, internal corporate web site?

Before sending one email or updating that web site, think about the
answers to these questions. People are inundated with communication
from email, voicemail, Twitter, Facebook/Google+, internal web/wikis,
text, IM. How can you deliver your message in the best way possible to
get the appropriate level of attention for your topic while not overly
burden the recipient(s)?

Communicating to internal customers
-----------------------------------

For those who are still communicating with internal customers via email,
consider how many emails you send and how long they are. 

Here's a hint with email: shorter is better. If you have to include
a long technical writeup, consider posting that on an internal
wiki/site and including a link for those interested.

Put the most important info at the top of the email. Many people will
skim the first few lines to see if an email applies to them. Consider
addressing it directly "All users of Macintosh systems" at the top of
the email. 

If the email requires an action, put that with a deadline in the very
first line: 
"The file cluster will be taken off-line for maintenance at 7:00pm
Friday, January 10th. Please save before that time so you do not lose
any of your work."

For major outages like the above, it is also good to give more than a
week notice for those people who are out of the office for a week or
more. You should also consider a followup message closer to the outage
to remind people that it is coming up. Forward the original email and
repeat the first line as a reminder.

Remember that we all get too much email. If you send an email every day,
or even every week, people will start to ignore/filter you. Consider how
critical it is to communicate with all of your customers at once. If you
limit it to topics that are important to them (outages, new service
announcements), they will be more likely to read and respond to your
attempts.

* How broadly does this information need to be communicated?
* Is there a sub-section of the population who are the only people who need this? 
* Look for avenues to limit how widely you distribute information so you are reaching the intended audience without burdening the rest of the organization..

Communicating to external customers
-----------------------------------

Communicating with external customers can offer additional challenges.
If the external customers are customers of your organization, there 
is the possibility that your dealings with them could result in a
complaint to your upper management.

You can reduce complaints by considering how you communicate with these
external customers. When communicating about a service outage, consider
timing of the outage, duration, and impact of the outage on these
external customers. Are most of your customers in the same time zone? If
so, then your maintenance window could be outside of traditional working
hours. If your external customers include international people in
varying timezones, you will have to choose an outage window that impacts
your core customers the least. 

Communicate maintenance windows decisions with your line management
for communication up the chain. It is best if your management knows
that their customers are about to be impacted by operations. You
may also need to include a justification for the maintenance: why
is it necessary, why did you choose this time window, how did you
come up with the duration, what happens if the outage goes beyond
the advertised window, how will you communicate to the external
customers? All of these pieces of information may not be necessary
if you have already established yourself as someone who supports
external customers on a regular basis.

Fielding customer complaints
----------------------------

In the world of operations, customer complaints are a given. You can't
please everyone all the time. Every operations person has dealt with
unhappy customers so it is good to develop strong people skills because
you are going to need them.

It is important to face customer complaints, not avoid them.
Occasionally we have a customer who is a chronic complainer and the
operations staff dive under their desks when that person walks in
the office. A complaint should be treated as an opportunity to
hear a customer's perception of services. Complaints can be turned
into opportunities for improvement and can be a path to creating a
lasting relationship with your customers.

People are often at their worst when reporting a complaint; emotions are
high due to lost data, a service outage, or frustration trying to
use technology. Now is not the time for you to get emotional or
defensive about your work. Instead of reacting, follow these steps
to adeptly manage customer unhappiness and maybe increase customer
respect for operations as a whole.

* Listen without judgment
* Rephrase the concern so you can confirm that you understood
* Agree to investigate if it isn't something you can resolve now or you don't have the time.
* Leave the customer with the assurance that you or someone will get back to him/her with a solution or feedback. 
* Get back to the customer even if it is to say 

 * It was a one-off problem and here is why 
 * We found a problem internally and it is now resolved 
 * We are improving our processes to reduce the likelihood of it happening again
 * Or an explanation that simply provides feedback to the customer.

* And don't forget to thank the customer for taking the time to provide feedback

The reason to close the feedback loop is to show the customer that you
did something as a result of the complaint. You may have only asked
your supervisor or officemate "was there a problem with the directory
server earlier?" but that isn't the point. The customer will hear
that you took some action to investigate and potentially resolve
the complaint. Maybe you discovered inconsistencies in your internal
procedures and by clarifying how to respond to specific issues, you
created a better service for everyone. That's a bonus for operations
and the customer should know that s/he had a positive impact.

You can try these techniques with chronic complainers. Sometimes all
they want is to be heard. Bring in your IT operations management if
someone is repeatedly impacting operations with complaints or becomes
abusive, This advice stands if you feel like you are trying the
techniques above and getting nowhere with the customer. Escalation to
the next person in the management chain is a valid procedural step
in any of these instances. 

Time Management
===============

Time management is a critical skill for the operations professional.
Customer service requests and trouble tickets are up against project
work and infrastructure maintenance and enhancements. How does one
person prioritize and accomplished?

Project Management
==================

Project management is a necessary skill for any mid-level operations
person. You might start with small projects and work your way up to
larger ones. 

Be aware that project customers, or stakeholders, will often not know
what they truly want from a project or they ask for the moon.  Familiarize 
yourself with the `project management triangle
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle>`_ (good, cheap, fast: pick two).

Henry Ford is credited with saying about his customers "If I had asked
customers what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."
Whether or not he said it, it still captures the essence of requirements
gathering for operations projects. You, the operations professional,
are the technology expert. The stakeholders know they want a certain
output or service. They may not know what that looks like or how to
achieve it. Your challenge is to extract requirements from the
stakeholders then realize that these may not be the real or complete
requirements. 

Enter project management. Project management should help you to
frame the scope, resources, goals, and outcomes for the project.
Let's look at two different project management methodologies as
they apply to operations.

Waterfall
---------

Waterfall is a hierarchical form of project management that was adapted
from other industries for the software development world. In waterfall,
think of the phases of a project as a cascading waterfall. Each phase
must be completed before moving onto the next phase. The entirety of the
project is scoped from beginning to end including milestones and
and final deliverables. 

Technologies change, requirements change and scoping a large project
over a long period of time with what are commonly incomplete
requirements or faulty assumptions by stakeholders leads operations down
a path of delivering an incomplete or inaccurate solution at the end.
Waterfall breaks down in practice because it requires a promise of
delivery that may be several years out.

Also, by requiring each phase a project to complete before moving
onto the next phase, bugs and issues are often not discovered until
late in the project. This causes delays and sometimes large amounts
of refactoring or re-architecting to go back and resolve these issues.

Detractors of the waterfall method point to its rigidity and
lack of testing during the development phase. One of the issues in
operations and development work is that stakeholders may not have
a solid grasp of requirements until they see a working prototype,
or iterations of working prototypes during the implementation of
the product. It is common for stakeholders in a project not to know
what technology can deliver until they see it. Many operations teams
are moving to Agile methods for several reasons and one of them is
because agile development allows stakeholders to see working bits
of the product before the end and to modify requirements before
it's too late.

Agile
-----

Agile is a project management methodology. Agile started in 2001
when a group of software developers created the Agile Manifesto.
The `Agile Manifesto <http://agilemanifesto.org/>`_ outlines the 12
principles of agile. Agile is seen most often in the software
development world but it has crept into operations because of the
obvious benefits over waterfall. Common implementations of Agile
include: Scrum, Kanban, and the hybrid Scrumban that was created
to meet more operational needs. The idea behind Agile is continuous
release or delivery of a product. Instead of creating one big outcome
at the end of a project, Agile allows a team to release a partially
completed project for stakeholder review and requirements tweaking.
Another big benefit of Agile methodologies is the discovery of
problems early in the product development cycle when refactoring
can be done immediately before the end product is set in a particular
architectural direction that would make it costly to change.

Some documented benefits of agile include the following:

* Reduced process overhead
* Improved team and stakeholder communication and collaboration
* Errors and bugs are fixed in development instead of waiting till the product is "complete" to address them.
* Stakeholders see the product as it is shaped and have the ability to adjust requirements during development
* Project teams are empowered
* Can easily be combined with DevOps methodology to improve effectiveness of development-into-operations
* If done well, can increase work output of teams (increased velocity)
* Everyone on the project can easily see where the project stands (e.g.  Scrum board or Kanban wall)

One thing to remember when implementing an Agile solution: adapt it to
your needs. Each of the following has its own simple framework, but
organizations can use some or all of the implementation and even combine
Agile methods to achieve success.  

Scrum
^^^^^
Scrum is the more prescriptive of the included methods. Scrum is
recognizable by Scrum boards, user stories, timeboxed sprints,
cross-functional teams, Scrum Master and Product Manager roles, the
burndown chart used for tracking project status, and the Scrum
meetings: daily stand-up, and retrospectives.

Some of the limiting factors of Scrum for operational teams include
timeboxing and tracking the burndown velocity of the team. 

Does all of this terminology seem foreign?

**Scrum board** - An electronic or physical board that is used to track
project status, actions that are in progress, upcoming work, and completed
work. A basic Scrum board will have three columns: Todo, In Progress.
Done. Items in todo are the up and coming work, items in "In Progress"
are currently being worked during this sprint. Done is fairly self
explanatory. Assignments can be tracked by sticky note on a white board
or via an electronic Scrum board.  The Scrum board also has rows. These
are referred to as swimlanes. Rows can be labeled with project names
and it common to have the very first swimlane titled "unplanned work"
for operations tasks that fall on the team.

**Electronic Scrum board** - Electronic Scrum board software can be great if
your team is geographically distributed. All members of the team can see
and update the board from remote locations. The downside of electronic
versions is getting the team to keep the application open and updated.
Burndown can also be computed automatically making it easier for
management to see progress.

**Physical Scrum board** - Often a whiteboard with a grid made of electrical
tape. The swimlanes and tasks are marked by sticky notes. The team names
can be post-it flags or some other marker. The downsides to a physical
board include manual tracking of burndown, stickies falling off the
board onto the floor (hint: Buy the Post-It super sticky notes or use
tape or magnets), and lastly distributed teams cannot see the board
easily. The upside to a physical board is visibility. The board can be
placed in a prominent location where the operations staff can see it
every day. This makes for easy daily stand-ups. It also allows members of
the team to walk up to the board and have conversations with other
members of the team about the work in progress.

**Sprint** - A sprint is a duration of time defined by the team when the work
will be done between Scrum meetings. Work is chunked into pieces small
enough to fit within the sprint window. A sprint window might be a week,
two weeks, four weeks, or whatever length of time seems to fit your
team. During the sprint, operations staff focus on the work agreed upon
at the beginning of the sprint. Organizations can define how unplanned
work will be dealt with during a sprint. Sometimes it is helpful to be
able to tell a customer that we can prioritize that project request in
two weeks at our next sprint meeting instead of feeling like operations
has to drop everything for a last minute request. Sprints are somewhat
rigid and can break down with operations because the work doesn't neatly
fit within a timeboxed window. The team will also provide time estimates
for each task.

**Daily Standup** - This is a short daily meeting with the team at the
Scrum board (virtual or physical). The person in the Scrum master role
leads the daily stand-up by asking each team member a few questions:
 
* What are you working on?
* Are there any impediments?
* Do you need anything to be successful?

Each member of the operations team now knows what is expected of him/her
for the day. Sometimes this is bad if the team is also responsible for
trouble tickets or responding to reactive work such as service outages. 

**Burndown** - The burndown tracks estimates of time with the actual time
spent working on a project's tasks. The resulting chart will show a
project approaching 0 as the level of effort needed to complete the
project winds down. Teams get better at estimating with experience.
Burndown can also show you if a project is taking longer than planned or
a head of schedule. Building a burndown chart can involve some Excel foo
(or choose your graphing application of choice). It is common to build
formulas in excel that will automatically update a pivot chart showing
the project tracking. Some burndown charts are very complex and others
are simple. Your organization has to decide how fancy to get with this
tool.

**User stories** - In Agile software development, user stories can be feature
requests, bugs, or modules the team plans to code for a product release.
In operations, user stories can be small or large projects. Smaller
projects are usually broken down into smaller more easily digestible
pieces otherwise a project can park in a swimlane for an inordinately
long time bringing down team morale and potentially impacting
productivity. Teams should see positive outcomes and accomplishments
across the swimlanes.

**Cross-functional teams** - In a development environment, a cross-functional
team could include developers, testers, management, and operations. The
purpose is to introduce DevOps to software development by including
roles that have a stake in the project at different levels. In
operations, a cross-functional team could include people from systems
administration, networking, security, and management.

Kanban
^^^^^^

Kanban is a much less prescriptive Agile implementation. Kanban can be
recognized by a similar task board to Scrum but often there are more
columns. Kanban's strength is the work in progress (WIP) limit. Kanban
doesn't require roles, timeboxing, or burndown tracking like Scrum. 

Because there is no timeboxed sprints, work continuously moves across
the swimlanes on the Kanban board. Daily stand-ups are critical in Kanban
because there isn't a touchpoint at the end of a sprint to review
completed work effort. Kanban boards can have several additional columns
to assist in the management of this continuous work flow. An example
Kanban board may have "Coming soon" "Review" "Available" "In progress"
"Acceptance" "Completed."  The purpose of these additional columns is to
enable teams to pull work into the "In progress" column as they finish
other work. The "In progress" column and other columns will have what is
called a WIP limit. There are a few schools of thought regarding WIP
limits. Each organization must experiment with the WIP limit until a
sweet spot is found for operations. 

In Kanban for operations, the columns can be varied across teams or
organizations. These columns are only provided as an example. Your
organization needs to find the Kanban workflow that works best for your
team.  There are several good resources that explain various ways of
configuring a Kanban board. Sticking with the current example, let's
review the columns in our example Kanban board so you can understand
their purpose.

* Coming soon - these are tasks, projects, or user requests. They are un prioritized and may be big or small.
* Review - These are tasks that are prioritized by management or the team during the daily stand-up. They are put "in the hopper" so to speak as work items that should be reviewed and possibly broken into smaller pieces if they are too large. The downside of too large is similar to Scrum when the user stories were too broad. If an in progress items its in the active queue too long, it takes up a WIP slot and can make it difficult to understand if the team is making progress on that item.
* Available - This item has been reviewed, broken into a reasonable sized task and approved by management or the team to be pulled into the active column at the next opportunity.
* In progress - Similar to Scrum, these are the tasks being worked actively by the team.
* Acceptance - When someone on the team considers a task complete, s/he moves it to this column. Acceptance means it is discussed at the next daily stand-up and possibly accepted as done by the team. Acceptance can also mean stakeholder acceptance. This could also be a testing phase for something that is rolling toward production. If something idles too long in this column, it will hold up other work because of the WIP in progress limits placed on this column. 
* Completed - These are tasks that are accepted as completed and put into production.

**Work in Progress (WIP) limits** WIP limits define the maximum number of
tasks that can appear in that column on the Kanban board. The two
schools of thought that seem to pervade include:

* 2n-1 - where n = the number of people on the operations team. The reason for this is to enable team members to work together on some tasks but to give enough tasks so team members stay busy.

* n-1 - where n = the number of people on the operations team.  The reason for this is to encourage collaboration on the team and not to overwhelm them with too many tasks. If someone on the team completes all of his/her work, that person should be able to pull the next available task from the "Available" column. 

What is the risk of having a WIP limit too low or too high? A high WIP
limit might mean the team is taking on too much at one time. Each member
of the team may get overwhelmed with the amount of work. Consider these
are reviewed daily in the stand-up meetings and team members can pull new
work from the "Available" column when current work moves to
"Acceptance." Also high WIP limits mean that team members are less
likely to work together on projects or tasks because each person has
his/her own work to complete.A WIP limit that is too low could create a
bottleneck, disallowing a team member from pulling new work into
the "In Progress" queue because other people on the team have hit
the WIP limit with their own work. The WIP limit is a sweet spot
that your organization needs to discover through experimentation.

Whenever there is a bottleneck in Kanban, the team can refocus its
efforts on the item stuck in the flow in order to unblock progress
across the board. WIP limits force this to occur because a column with a
WIP limit of 3 on the acceptance column will not allow any tasks to move
to that column if there are already 3 items waiting for acceptnaca. It
is a way to keep work moving across the board.

Scrumban
^^^^^^^^

Scrumban is a hybrid of the two previously mentioned methodologies.
Operations teams seem to embrace Kanban or Scrumban because of the
flexibility of re-prioritizing daily and the WIP limits that keep the
team from getting overwhelmed. 

A Scrumban implemenation would take elements from both Scrum and Kanban.
For example, you might decide to define some roles, keep the review and
retrospectives, hold the daily standup from Scrum while enforcing WIP
limits and implement continuous work flow from Kanban.

The Tao of DevOps
=================

What is DevOps
--------------

DevOps seeks to include the IT operations team as an important
stakeholder in the development process. Instead of developers solely
coding to meet the stakeholder's requirements on time and on budget,
they are also held responsible for how easily it deploys, how few
bugs turn up in production, and how well it runs. Basically, how
easily can operations support the product once it rolls into
production. Instead of bringing operations into the conversation
after the product is complete, the DevOps methodology includes
operations in the development stream.

Development's view: 

* Roll a product out to meet customer specifications within a certain timeframe
* Continuous delivery means recurring change as bugs are fixed and features added
* fast changing environments are needed to support dev
* agility is key

Operation's view:

* supporting the product for customers
* keeping a handle on IT security
* planning for deployment to production state 
* changes are slow/incremental
* consistent environments are needed to support operations
* stability is key

Why DevOps is important
-----------------------

In organizations where DevOps is not a priority, development is
often viewed as customer-focused by trying to solve problems and
deliver solutions while operations is viewed as a barrier to
development's mission.  By combining these two, often competing
mindsets, both sides can be satisfied and the result is a product
that potentially has fewer bugs, higher availability, increased
security, and a process for improved development over the life of
the product that works for both the developers and the operations
people.

Some are also talking about implementing a DevOps methodology in pure
operations teams. In this scenario the operations team is also
Development because they stand up a webserver, provision virtual
machines, or code configuration management systems. In this case,
operations needs to wear both the development and operations hats by
meeting customer needs while also addressing security and supportability
of the solution.

What isn't DevOps
-----------------
A person cannot be a DevOp. You don't hire a DevOp. 


Business Acumen in Operations
=============================

What is business acumen? Business acumen a leadership competency simply
defined as a general understanding of business principles that leads
to an organization's success. We aren't trying to turn every operations
person into a senior executive, but development of business
acumen as applied to operations can sure help to bridge the gap
between your organization's senior leadership and the operations
team. Business acumen as applied to operations works on multiple
levels. In many organizations, operations is a service unit within
the larger organization but it also serves the needs of the
organization as a whole. The savvy operations person will look at
operations within that context, applying the following skills to
appropriately position operations and act with the best interests of the
greater organization in mind. This also helps when trying to make your
organization DevOps friendly.

Distilling the definition of business acumen for operations yields the
following important skillsets:
* Understand the role of operations within the context of your organization to correctly position operations. 
* Think broadly about decisions and act decisively 
* Support and promote change as needed
* Develop basic business skills that allow operations to communicate within the executive suite

Understanding the role of operations
------------------------------------
Under any of the operations professions, the most fundamental role
of the operations person is to deliver services to a set of customers.
To build upon this further, the operations person maintains existing IT
infrastructures, translates customer requirements into tangible and
actionable solutions, assists in the protection of customer information
and services, and advises stakeholders on application of technology
under existing limitations of time, money, or capabilities.

By thinking of operations as a business unit instead of a forgotten
office within the organization, the operations engineer is already
thinking at the correct level to assess how to support the needs
of the organization.

Understand how your organization competes within its industry.
Commercial entities, non-profits, educational institutions, government
agencies all measure success in some way. For commerce, it will be sales
and profit. For educational institutions, it might be numbers of
incoming students and retention rate of students. For a non-profit it
might be the number of people willing to give to support the work of the
organization and the number of people who use its services.

All of this leads to correct positioning of operations within your
organization.

* What are the core competencies of operations and how do they serve the internal business units and the organization as a whole?

* What core competencies are you missing and should develop in order to better support your organization's mission?

Maintaining Existing IT Infrastructures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most visible role of Operations is to maintain the status quo.
For the system administrator this means maintaining servers and
processes such as logging, monitoring, backups, authentication, or
naming services. For the network administrator it means maintaining
routers, switches, the edge network, gateways, or the relationship
with the corporate Internet Service Provider (ISP). A security
engineer might be responsible for maintaining a vulnerability
scanning capability, incident response policy and processes, intrusion
detection systems, firewalls, and a customer security awareness
training program. Operations may also be responsible for maintaining
access to internal services (e.g. financial systems, corporate content
management systems, procurement systems, etc.) that may impact the
various business units within the organization. These roles are
distinct but there is sometimes overlap between them in smaller
organizations where fewer people server in multiple roles.

Translating Customer Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operations roles are customer service positions. These careers
require a level of customer interaction because the services delivered
by the Operations professional must be driven by customer needs.
In this case, customer is used to mean the business, organization,
or other entity that is employing the Operations professional. Some
questions to ask to help the Operations person understand requirements
from the customer perspective:

* What is the core mission of this organization?
* How does Operations support, hinder, or allow your organization to innovate for the mission?
* Who are your core customers (internal, external, or both)?
* What does the organization need from the Operations professionals?
* Why should this organization come to these Operations people for this service or solution? (What is the value proposition for Operations within this organization?)?
* How could Operations provide more value: higher level of competitiveness, faster service delivery, stronger security, or other benefit that aligns with the mission?

Translating customer requirements is key to focusing the efforts
of Operations. Operations work can be a slippery slope where the
professionals are spreading themselves too thin on projects and
deliverables that do not serve the organization's mission. One way
to focus the efforts of Operations is to answer these questions and
to ensure that the Operations organization, whether insourced or
outsourced, is delivering services that provide the most value.

Protection of Information and Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often the Operations professionals in an organization are the people
who most completely understand the technical risk to organizational
assets from an IT perspective. Senior management within an organization
will usually understand risks related to financials, competition,
manufacturing, etc. but they often do not understand IT enough to make
an informed decision. Operations professionals are the ones with the
deep-dive technical expertise required to comprehend risks, threats,
vulnerabilities, and countermeasures then translate them into
language senior management can understand.

This is another area where the Operations professional is communicating
with the organization's leaders to advise on appropriate actions
to address IT security where it makes sense for the organization.

Areas where organizations need the Operations professional
to advice on IT security could include threats to data from internal
and external sources, hardware failure, site availability or
resilience, data preservation, and information integrity. Again,
these areas are dependent on the organization's mission.

For example: an ecommerce organization will most likely want strong
site availability and protection of customer personal information.
The Operations professionals might build a site with high resilience
and availability including use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs),
strong encryption not only for the ecommerce session but also data
at rest, role-based access for internal employees accessing customer
information to reduce access to only those people who need access
to that information. Organizational leaders often do not understand
how these solutions are implemented so it is up to the Operations
professional to communicate the threat, solution, cost, impact to
the organization of implementing the solution.

Advising within Current Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Operations professional who advises an organization must also
consider limitations that impact the potential solution. Cost,
timing, expertise within the organization, available time of the
people who would implement the solution, or IT security issues may
be considerations. For example, decision makers within the
organization will need to know what is possible and for what cost
so they can make the decision how to spend the organization's money.
Good, fast, or cheap (pick two): it may be the Operations professional's
responsibility to explain this concept from an IT perspective.

Thinking broadly and acting decisively 
--------------------------------------

These people can look at a problem from the viewpoint of other
people and business units within the organization. Instead of insular
thinking, they come at a problem with a broad-minded perspective.
How do decisions impact other areas of the organization and,
alternatively, how does the organization view this particular issue?
Those with strong acuity for business will see the big picture and
be able to understand the implications of a decision on more than
just operations.

In some cases it may not be a problem, but an opportunity that injects
potential life into an organization or recalibrates it. Business
leaders, stakeholders, customers or whatever you call them often don't
understand what technology can do for them. Operations should understand
the organization well enough to see where technology can support
innovation. This leads into change as a constant.

What would it take to make this happen? What are the missing ingredients
for success?

Promoting Change 
----------------

The operations world changes rapidly, more rapidly than other sectors.
Operations people cannot afford to to a specific operating environment,
hardware platform, or technical solution because the industry has
already started moving toward the next innovation. 

Building basic business skills
------------------------------

Basic business skills could be as simple as learning to use Excel
to build a basic budget or navigating internal business systems and
such as procurement, capital expenditures (CapEx), contracts.  Some
skills are the same everywhere (e.g. Excel) and some require study of
the internal organization (e.g. procurement). Understanding CapEx means
being able to compute depreciation but also understanding the CapEx
calendar within your organization, how that money is spent, and how to
request capital spending using your organization's process.

Budgeting and Financial Skills
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A basic knowledge of Excel includes formulas, formatting for
readability, using multiple worksheets, and importing external data,
More advanced Excel knowledge includes use of macros, pivot tables and
pivot charts.

Some operations folks use other Excel-like programs such as OpenOffice
or LibreOffice spreadsheet programs. Use caution when using something
that your senior leaders do not use. If your whole organization has
adopted LibreOffice as the standard spreadsheet application, that works.
The problem occurs when your boss wants to share your spreadsheet with
some of the organization's senior leaders and the file format doesn't
translate exactly or the file is unreadable to them. In this case, you
are trying to bridge the gap between operations and the executive suite,
so try to use their tools when possible to avoid small issues that can
cause frustration to the people you are trying to persuade.

Building a basic budget requires institutional knowledge. How is
employee labor computed?  You need to understand what income you have 
and where it comes from? Are any employees billable to other projects?
You may have a flat budgetary structure with a single cost center
for all labor or you may have multiple cost centers. Is there any
income that has special restrictions? How do you purchase things such as
parts, services, software, contractor services?  Do you have to account
for overages or money not spent at the end of the fiscal year? 

Generally organizations have financial people who can provide reports
for various cost centers. If operations fits neatly within one or more
cost centers, these reports can help you build your budget. If
operations is combined with other projects or business units, then the
work of separating operation's budget becomes a bit more complex.
Starting with these reports is a good first step.

To really understand how these reports work, you should understand how
operations is paid and how it spends within the organization. 

How is operations funded?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Where does operation's base funding originate?

* Is Operations billable or do they have constant funding from year-to-year?
* Does someone need to request this money or is it always there?
* How are pay increases funded?
* Is there only one source of money or are there multiple income streams?

Does everything come out of one cost center or are there multiple cost centers?

* If multiple, are they broken down by project, type of expenditure (labor, contractors, services, supplies)? 

Is any of the money special?

* Does it expire 
* Does it come with strings/hooks to specific projects or billables?

How does operations spend?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* How are employee salaries computed to include benefits and overhead?
* How are contractors paid?  
* Are there special rules for obligations? In some organizations, some kinds of money must be allocated up front and cannot be reclaimed even if not spent until after the contract or service has completed or the fiscal year has ended.
* How do operational purchases work within your organization (parts, services, software, training, travel, supplies)?  Who pays for these purchases? Who tracks these expenses?
* Does your organization have a CapEx process and where does that money originate?  Does depreciation impact your budget?
* Are there any hidden costs?

 * Service fees from internal organizations?

Answering these questions and looking at reports from within should give
you most of the answers you need. You may have to implement your own
tracking to get some answers if they aren't easily identified in the
reports.

Why would any sane operations person want to go through all of this to
assemble a budget:

* Operations is understaffed and wants to ask senior management to hire more people
* There has been staff turnover and operations needs to fill those positions. How much is available and what opportunities exist to do something different? 
* Senior management is asking hard questions about the operations budget (e.g. why do we spend so much on operations, where does the money go?).
* You want to bring in a student or contractor to help with some short-term work but you need to demonstrate that operations is spending wisely in order to get approval for an increase.

Budgeting for impact
++++++++++++++++++++

Just putting numbers in a spreadsheet isn't budgeting. What do the
numbers tell you? Are you spending too much on senior people?
Equipment?  Vendor maintenance? Where is the majority of your
spending (commonly it is labor)?  An easy to present budget can
also help you to understand if operations is well managed. 

Take that same view of the budget that gave you visibility into
operations and use it to support a request or a claim to senior
management. 

Let's take the example of a senior person leaving the organization.
Operations needs to fill that slot with a new person to avoid getting
overwhelmed. 

* Does this vacant position present an opportunity? 
* Does operations need to hire someone with specialized experience in a new area? 
* Could operations benefit from hiring two junior level people using the same salary slot as the former senior person? Does that work mathematically within your organization's hiring rules?
* Could you reduce the overall cost of operations to help the organization by hiring one junior person and growing that person?
* Could you hire a junior person and use the remaining money to refresh hardware or invest in a new technology to help the organization?

You can probably see how you could make some of these arguments
mathematically in a spreadsheet. The part that is missing is the "why"
and that's where the impact comes in. Senior management may believe that
operations needs to reduce overall costs. This is when you need
non-numerical supporting evidence to persuade management that operations
does need to hire a specialist or make the case for an apprentice that
would achieve a cost savings but would reduce capabilities until the
person came up to speed within the operations team. Budget decisions
have consequences, make sure those impacts are clearly illustrated
within the numbers but also be prepared to explain the non-monetary
impacts. This includes risks to the organization such as reduction in
capabilities.

When preparing for a big budget presentation where you are asking for
a decision that will impact operations, consider the following
supporting strategies:
 
* Enlist customer support. Customers are asking for improved capabilities, better response, new technology. How can they provide input to management that operations needs more or different resources to serve them better?

* Find out if there are any new initiatives within the organization that would rely on specific expertise or additional operations resources.  This demonstrates a tangible need (e.g. Project X will require 50% of someone from operations to implement their technical plan).

Using these additional supports requires knowing your organization and
having a good relationship with your customers. Ideally customers come
to operations in the planning stages of new projects in order to get
feedback on potential technology issues before they begin work.  That
makes this step a bit easier. If not, then you can begin your
reconnaissance by talking to project leaders or middle management within
the organization. 

When researching organizational needs, start with some basic questions:

* Are you planning anything new in the next year?
* What projects is your group starting?
* What technologies are we not using that you think would make your unit more productive?
* Does operations provide the right level of support to your division?

**Exercise:**

Now, the budget you build should directly respond to the problem or
issue you are trying to address. Choose a scenario from above or make up
your own. 

* How would you build a basic budget to persuade senior management on your issue? 
* What would be important to highlight? 
* What non-monetary supporting information would help your cause?

The cost benefit analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Navigating the capital expenditure process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Capital expenditure (CapEx) process is used by organizations to
purchase assets that have value across multiple tax years. In operations 
CapEx usually means new equipment or equipment that extends the useful
life of existing equipment beyond the existing tax year.

CapEx allows an organization to depreciate an asset over the estimated
useful lifespan of that asset. How is this valuable? Well, on the
organization's balance sheet, only part of the total expense is counted
for a specific tax year. The amount of the expense depends on the type
of depreciation used. 

Straight Line Depreciation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With straight line depreciation, assets are depreciated at an equal
amount each year. So a piece of equipment with an estimated useful
lifespan of 4 years would be depreciated 25% per year on the
organization's expense sheet. 

Accelerated Depreciation
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Accelerated depreciation usually frontloads the depreciation costs. This
method may more accurately reflect the value of equipment because there
is a greater depreciation at the beginning of the cycle. An example of
accelerated deprecation might require a piece of equipment to be
depreciated over 4 years at a rate of 40 percent per year. Obviously you
would have a greater expense in the first year because you calculate 40%
of the total value of the asset. In the second year, you compute 40% of
the remaining value, and so on until you get to the fourth year or $0.

An analogy to help explain Accelerated depreciation might be the
purchase of a new car. The car depreciates the moment you drive it off
the lot. Even if you were to sell the car soon after purchasing it, the
car has already sigificantly decreased in value. 

Building a business case
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Distilling information for impact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This skill goes hand-in-hand with budget but it is also an excellent
standalone skill. Operations deals with complex implementation of
technology whether or not you realize it. To the non-technical person,
the architectural diagram on your whiteboard looks like a Rube Goldberg
machine.

The further up the management chain you go, the more distilled your
information should get. Senior leaders do not usually need or want
deep-dive technical detail. When presenting a complex solution, it is
fine to have one diagram that is completely unintelligible to them as
long as it is only used to to demonstrate that operations did more than
throw a blade in a rack and spin it up to achieve the solution. The most
important part of the presentation is the part where you answer the
questions in the heads of your senior leaders even before they ask them. 

What are their questions?

* What are we trying to accomplish? 
* What do we do today and how is this better?
* How do we know this is the best solution? 
* Do we have the right people to make it happen?
* How much will it cost?
* How long will it take?
* What is the benefit if we do it?
* What is the risk if we don't do it?
* How do we know if it worked?

**Exercise**

Take an idea you have and use the questions above to try to build a case
for senior management to fund this idea.

Specific Examples
=================

Below are some specific examples to demonstrate the importance of soft
skills in operations. In each example, soft skills closed the deal
because they enabled the operations person to see the situation from
other perspectives and communicate the needs of operations in terms of
the organization as a whole.

The importance of Documentation
===============================

What to document
----------------

* Runbooks? SOP? (cparedes: might be worthwhile even though we want to automate
  SOP's away as much as possible - what should we check at 2 AM? What do folks
  typically do in this situation if automation fails?)

* Architecture and design (cparedes: also maybe talk about *why* we choose that
  design - what problems did we try to solve? Why is this a good solution?) How
  to manage documentation

Documentation through Diagrams
------------------------------

**Anecdote** At one job we had a single network engineer. He had a
habit of walking up to a whiteboard to explain something to the
systems folks. He would proceed to draw what we considered a
hyper-complex-looking diagram showing the current or future state
of some networking solution. We could never keep his configurations
in our heads like he did and he wasn't always around when we had a
question. One of us figured out that we should take a picture of
the whiteboard after he finished drawing. These pictures went into
the operations wiki. They weren't beautiful but they saved us time
when we could easily refer back to the pictures we took.

Diagrams don't always have to be professional visio-quality to count as
documentation.

Learning and strategies for improvement
=======================================

Explicit vs Tacit knowledge
---------------------------

*Explicit knowledge* can be defined as that gained from books or listening to a 
lecture. Basically some form of reading or auditory resource. It is typically
easy to transfer to others, an example would be a manual for driving and 
operating a car.

*Tacit knowledge* can be defined and describes as that gained from experience, 
action and practice. It is typically difficult to transfer this type of 
knowledge to other people. A good example would be flying a plane.

Let's start off by making a distinction between different types of knowledge. 
The practice of system administration relies heavily on both types of learning 
so just one type of experience is not enough to be great in this field.
Essentially, the two knowledge types work hand in hand. So for example, reading
a ton of books, while useful in its own right will not be nearly as effective 
as reading books and then applying the knowledge gained from hands on 
experience. Likewise, if somebody never bothers to pickup a book and relies 
entirely on hands experiences they will not be as knowledgeable as someone who 
incorporates both types of knowledge. It is in the opinion of many in the field
that much more can be learned from hands on experience than by books alone.

Types of learning
-----------------

There has been a good deal of research done on this subject but for the purposes
of this post I would like to boil this all down to what are considered the three
primary or main styles of learning. Types of learning play an important role 
because they work hand in hand with explicit and tacit knowledge. Each one of 
these different styles represents a different sort of idiom to the learning 
experience. So here they are:

* Visual
* Auditory
* Kinesthetic

It can be argued that employing a good variety of learning and study methods 
would be the most appropriate way to develop your skills as a sysadmin or any 
other career related in the operations field. Instead of saying
that one is better than another, one should employ all of these
types learning in their own life.  Take a look at yourself and
figure out how you learn best and then decide which method(s) are
the most and least helpful and then decide how to make these styles
work to your advantage.

For example, having a piece of reading material as a reference or as an 
introduction is great. If the subject material is difficult and isn't easily 
understood, a good next step to take is internalizing things by listening to or 
watching others. Finally, with a good enough understanding about a topic, 
quickly put things into your own experiences. It is much more easy to remember 
things when you are able to experience them yourself.

Learning strategies
-------------------

It is important to highlight some of the major tactics that can be utilized when
attempting to learn a new subject. Here are some different strategies and 
techniques for learning new and difficult to understand information. Many of 
these strategies work together or in tandem so they may described more than 
once.

**The Feynman technique** – This is as close to the end all be all that there is
when it comes to learning. Everybody is probably familiar with this one, but am
guessing the name is unfamiliar. This technique is used to explain or go 
through a topic as if you were teaching it to somebody else that was just 
learning about it for the first time. This basically forces you to know what 
you’re talking about. If you get stuck when trying to explain a particular 
concept or idea, make a note of what you are struggling with and research and 
relearn the material until you can confidently explain it. You should be able 
to explain the subject simply, if your explanations are wordy or convoluted you 
probably don’t understand it as well as you think.

**Reading** – This is a great technique to get an introduction to a topic by 
reading up on (and bookmarking) what information you feel to be the most 
important, whether it be official documentation, RFC’s, books, magazines, 
respected blogs and authors, etc. It is a good idea to take very brief notes 
when something looks like it would useful so to try it out yourself.

**Watching/Listening to others** – After getting a good idea from reading about 
a subject it is good to reinforce this by either watching demonstrations, 
videos, listening to podcasts, lectures or anything else that will show how to 
get a better idea of how to do something. An example of this would be to put on
a podcast. It kills time as well as improves knowledge at the cost of nothing.
Very efficient! The same with videos and demonstrations, the only thing holding
you back is the motivation.

**Try things for yourself** – Sometimes this can be the most difficult approach 
but definitely can also be the most rewarding, there is nothing better than 
learning things the hard way. Try things out for yourself in a lab or anywhere 
that you can practice the concepts that you are attempting to learn and 
understand.

**Take notes** – This is important for your own understanding of how things 
work in a way that you can internalize. Take notes on simple things like 
commands you know you won’t remember, related topics and concepts or even just 
jotting down keywords quickly to Google for later on. This goes hand in hand 
with the reading technique described above, just jotting down very simple, 
brief notes can be really useful.

**Communicate with others** - There are plenty of resources out there for 
getting help and for communicating and discussing what you learn with others. 
/r/sysadmin would be a good starting point. IRC channels are another great 
place to ask questions and get help, there are channels for pretty much any 
subject you can think of out there. There are good sysadmin related channels at
irc.freenode.net, if you don’t already utilize IRC, take a look.

**Come back later** – Give your brain some time to start digesting some of the 
information and to take a step back and put the pieces together to begin 
creating a bigger picture. If you have been working on learning a new concept 
or subject and felt overwhelmed and feel stuck, take a break. Do something 
completely different or think about something else entirely and came back to 
the subject later on with a fresh perspective. Sometimes these difficult 
subjects just take time to fully understand so taking breaks and clearing your 
head can be very useful.

**Sleep on it** – Have you ever heard of the term before? This may sound crazy 
but sometimes if there is a particular problem that you're struggling with, 
think about it before going to sleep. By blocking out all outside interference
and noise it is much easier think about, come up with fresh perspectives and 
ideas and often times you will wake up with an answer the next morning.

**Break stuff** – One of the best ways to incorporate a number of these 
techniques is to intentionally break stuff in your own setups. Triple check to 
be sure that nothing important will get broken first and then go ahead and give 
it a try. A much deeper and more intimate relationship with the way things work, why they 
work and how they get broken occurs when things get broken. The great thing about 
using this method is that it is almost always useful for something in the future, 
whether it be the troubleshooting skills, the Googling skills or the specific 
knowledge in the particular area that needed to be fixed.

**Practice, practice, practice** – There is just no way around it.To get 
better at something one must dedicate time and be prepared to practice like an 
absolute maniac. For operations roles and system administration
this can partially come from practical job experience but it also
comes from dedicated study and lab time. The hands on component is
where most experience and time will come from and becoming better
doesn’t just happen, it takes cultivation and time, just like with
any other skill. Stick with it and never stop learning and improving
on your skillset through practice and experience.

Things to keep in mind as you learn how to be an engineer
=========================================================

General Tips for improvement
----------------------------

These simple tips can go a really long way. There is no magical instant way to 
improve yourself. If you take nothing else, just remember the following. The 
best way to see results and really work on yourself starts by changing your 
habits, working hard and being consistent.That might not be what you are 
looking for, but it has been proven to be true time and again that
even by making just these few adjustments can go a long way in
becoming better at what you do.

**Exercise** - Just doing a Google search will reveal all the
information on the massive benefits of proper exercise. Even just
this one tip can make a huge difference in the way you think and
feel. It is not recommended to completely change the way you live
your life when starting out, especially if you are sedentary. Just
make a simple change as something to start with and work from there.
There are many benefits of exercising and working your body regularly
will help you improve your mind.

**Sleep** - This is probably the most important thing to remember when you are 
trying to work on hacking your mind and improving yourself. 8 hours of sleep 
seems to be the general rule of thumb, and it should not be overlooked when you 
are evaluating yourself and your goals for getting to where you want to be. If 
you want to wake up early, you need to go to sleep early, it really is as simple
as that. It is also important to be consistent on your sleep schedule so your 
body can get used to when it should slow down and when it should speed up (even 
on weekends!). For example, getting in a routine of winding down at a certain 
time, say 9 pm every night by reading a book for an hour to train your body 
that it is time to sleep. Read until say 10 pm every night if you want to wake 
up at 6 am to get the sleep consistency your body needs, also giving your body 
enough time to repair and heal itself to get up and going.

**Diet** - Also important. Everybody is different so please take this advice at
face value. As with anything else, it is not recommended to go all out and 
make completely polar changes to every eating habit at once. You will crash 
and burn like many others.So while it may work for some you generally will be
safer and more likely to make a lasting impact if you take things slowly. Work 
on one thing at a time and gradually make the changes to improve your diet and 
health. As an example, start by cutting out something small, like cutting out 
a particular type of food that isn’t exactly healthy. Not entirely, but even 
just cutting back is a good first step. Basically doing something is better 
than doing nothing.
