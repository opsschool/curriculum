What is the role of Operations?
========================
Under any of the Operations professions, the most fundamental role
of the Operations person is to deliver services to a set of customers.
To build upon this the Operations person maintains existing IT
infrastructures, translates customer requirements into tangible and
actionable solutions, assists in the protection of customer information
and services, and advises stakeholders on application of technology
under existing limitations of time, money, or capabilities.

Maintaining Existing IT Infrastructures
---------------------------------------

The most visible role of Operations is to maintain the status quo.
For the system administrator this means maintaining servers and
processes such as logging, monitoring, backups, authentication, or
naming services. For the network administrator it means maintaining
routers, switches, the edge network, gateways, or the relationship
with the corporate Internet Service Provider (ISP). A security
engineer might be responsible for maintaining a vulnerability
scanning capability, incident response policy and processes, intrusion
detection systems, firewalls, and a customer security awareness
training program. These roles are distinct but there is sometimes
overlap between them in smaller organizations where fewer people
server in multiple roles.

Translating Customer Requirements
---------------------------------
Operations roles are customer service positions. These careers
require a level of customer interaction because the services delivered
by the Operations professional must be driven by customer needs.
In this case, customer is used to mean the business, organization,
or other entity that is employing the Operations professional. Some
questions to ask to help the Operations person understand requirements
from the customer perspective:

* What is the core mission of this organization?
* How does Operations support the mission?
* What does the organization need from the Operations professionals?
* Why should this organization come to these Operations people for this service or solution? (What is the value proposition for Operations within this organization?)
* How could Operations provide more value: higher level of competitiveness, faster service delivery, stronger security, or other benefit that aligns with the mission?

Translating customer requirements is key to focusing the efforts
of Operations. Operations work can be a slippery slope where the
professionals are spreading themselves too thin on projects and
deliverables that do not serve the organizations mission. One way
to focus the efforts of Operations is to answer these questions and
to ensure that the Operations organization, whether insourced or
outsourced, is delivering services that provide the most value.

Protection of Information and Services
--------------------------------------

Often the Operations professionals in an organization are the people
who most completely understand the technical risk to organizational
assets from an IT perspective. Senior management within an organization
will usually understand risks related to financials, competition,
manufacturing, etc. but they often do not understand IT enough to make
an informed decision. Operations professionals are the ones with the
deep-dive technical expertise required to comprehend risks, threats,
vulnerabilities, and countermeasures then translate them into
language senior management can understand.

This is another area where the Operations professional is communicating
with the organization's leaders to advise on appropriate actions
to address IT security where it makes sense for the organization.

Areas where organizations need the Operations professional
to advice on IT security could include threats to data from internal
and external sources, hardware failure, site availability or
reslience, data preservation, and information integrity. Again,
these areas are dependent on the organization's mission.

For example: an ecommerce organization will most likely want strong
site availability and protection of customer personal information.
The Operations professionals might build a site with high reslience
and availability including use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs),
strong encryption not only for the ecommerce session but also data
at rest, role-based access for internal employees accessing customer
information to reduce access to only those people who need access
to that information. Organizational leaders often do not understand
how these solutions are implemented so it is up to the Operations
professional to communicate the threat, solution, cost, impact to
the organization of implementing the solution.

Advising within Current Limitations
-----------------------------------

The Operations professional who advises an organization must also
consider limitations that impact the potential solution. Cost,
timing, expertise within the organization, available time of the
people who would implement the solution, or IT security issues may
be considerations. For example, decision makers within the
organization will need to know what is possible and for what cost
so they can make the decision how to spend the organization's money.
Good, fast, or cheap (pick two): it may be the Operations professional's
responsibility to explain this concept from an IT perspective.

The importance of Documentation
===============================

What to document
----------------

* Runbooks? SOP? (cparedes: might be worthwhile even though we want to automate
  SOP’s away as much as possible - what should we check at 2 AM? What do folks
  typically do in this situation if automation fails?)

* Architecture and design (cparedes: also maybe talk about *why* we choose that
  design - what problems did we try to solve? Why is this a good solution?) How
  to manage documentation

Documentation through Diagrams
