Load Balancing
**************

Why do we use load balancers?
=============================

* A fast, HTTP/TCP based load balancer can distribute between slower application
  servers, and can keep each application server running optimally
* They keep application servers busy by buffering responses and serving them to
  slow clients (or keepalives). We want app servers to do real work, not waste
  time waiting on the network.
* Load balancers provide a mechanism to verify the health of backend servers to
  ensure traffic is only routed to backends available to service the request.
  These health checks can be simplistic ICMP pings to ensure host availability
  to advanced HTTP (layer 7) health checks that use HTTP response codes or
  content matching.
* Can provide a layer of abstraction such that end user endpoints remain
  consistent (i.e URLs) as backend application infrastructure expands
  (or contracts)
* Can be either software based (aka reverse proxies) or hardware based (physical
  devices optimized for network throughput and ISO layer 2,3 and 4 routing).
* Can be tuned by itself for max conns?
* HTTP path based routing, 1 domain to multiple heterogeneous server pools.

Application implications
========================

Backend
-------

An application server behind a load balancer is typically referred to as a
"backend" or "backend server".

Pools
-----

A collection of backends is referred to as a pool.

Balancing algorithms
--------------------

Session Affinity
----------------

Session affinity or session stickiness, is when the load balancer applies an
algorithm to the incoming connection to direct it to a single server. This
is typically done for HTTP applications by setting cookies. In general TCP
applications often use IP addresses to determine the server to direct
the connection to.

Local & ISP caching
-------------------

SSL Termination and Offloading
------------------------------

SSL Termination is when the load balancer established an SSL connection
between the client and the load balancer and a non-encrypted connection between
the load balancer and backend server.

Terminating SSL on the load balancer eliminates the need to distribute your
certificate and key amongst all the servers. When using hardware load balancers
they typically have special hardware acceleration which is much more performant
compared to terminating connections on the backend server.

Balancing vs. Failover (Active / Passive)
-----------------------------------------

Often load balancing is used as a high-availability technique, by allowing
multiple backends to service a request if one node should become unavailable. It
differs from failover configuration because all nodes generally participate in
servicing clients. In failover configurations a single (active) node handles all
requests until an issue arises, and the secondary (passive) node takes over all
of the incoming traffic. Failover configurations are usually not configured for
scaling purposes.

Health Checks
---------------

Most load balancers have some ability to test backend servers for availability,
these are called health checks. They can be as simple as whether hosts are
responding on the port the application is bound to, or complex configurations
that test special URIs, or response times. If a server fails a health check the
load balancer will temporarily remove the node from the pool, until it
successfully passes the health check.

Non-HTTP use cases
==================

Native SMTP, or general TCP for things like RabbitMQ, MongoDB, etc

Software
========

Apache
------

Apache has the ability to load balance using ``mod_proxy_balancer``, and ``mod_jk``.

Mod_proxy_balancer is purpose-built load balancing solution. It supports the HTTP, FTP,
and AJP protocols. There is basic support for sessions stickiness's, weighted round-robin,
and can remove unhealthy backends from the balancing pool. It lacks support for customizable
health checks, other TCP protocols. Support for AJP is provided by ``mod_proxy_ajp`` and support
for FTP is provided by ``mod_proxy_ftp``.

``Mod_jk`` supports the AJPv1.2 and AJPv1.3 protocols. It's a purpose build connector to support
the Java application servers, like Apache Tomcat. It supports weighted round-robin, session
stickiness, session counting, traffic based routing, and backend busyness (server with the least
connections). It supports health checks using the method built into AJP protocol.


Nginx
-----

Nginx is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. Nginx is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.

Nginx is one of a handful of servers written to address the C10K problem. Unlike traditional servers, Nginx doesn’t rely on threads to handle requests. Instead it uses a much more scalable event-driven (asynchronous) architecture. This architecture uses small, but more importantly, predictable amounts of memory under load. Even if you don’t expect to handle thousands of simultaneous requests, you can still benefit from Nginx’s high-performance and small memory footprint. Nginx scales in all directions: from the smallest VPS all the way up to large clusters of servers.

Many famous sites make use of Nginx. For example Netflix, Github, WordPress, etc.

Some people either choose for Apache or Nginx. These two are the most common used. Both of them are alternative web server softwares which serve web pages in response to browser requests. Nginx is better as in that it's more secure than apache and because Nginx doesn't need to spawn new processes or threads for each request that is being received, which is the case for Apache. Also, it's very ideal for high traffic websites. Also, Nginx is compatible with most platforms, for example WordPress, which is a platform that is used very often. 

Ofcourse there's not only advantages about Nginx, but there's also a few downsides to it. It's known that it is very difficult to create modules using Nginx. Apache doesn't have this disadvantage, but Nginx has no function such as the Apache Portable Runtime. Therefore the creator needs to find the function needed for creating the module within the internal code of Nginx.

When you don't have Nginx installed yet, you can install it by using the command ``yum install nginx``. Once installed, you can apply certain actions with the ``nginx -s signal`` where the signal paramter can be one of the following: ``stop``, ``quit``, ``reload``, ``reopen``. Once Nginx is installed, it can be configured in the following configuration file: ``/etc/nginx/nginx.conf``.

HAProxy
-------

HAProxy is a general TCP load balancing server that is highly configurable. It
will generally support any TCP based protocol, and has special modes for HTTP,
RDP, MySQL, and Postgresql protocols. It has support for multiple types of
health check including URL based, traffic-based health, and external checks via
the ``httpchk`` options. It has several load balancing algorithms: round robin,
static round-robin, least connections, source hashing, URI hashing, URI
parameter, and RDP-cookie.


Hardware
========

BIG-IP
------

BIG-IP has purpose-built hardware load balancers. They support protocols in layers
2, 4, and 7 of the OSI model. They allow for very complex configurations, and
support writing special TCL programs to modify the load balancing behavior. The
product supports SSL termination and offloading, with additional licensing.

Netscaler
---------

Multi-dc
========

Anycast
-------

DNS GSLB
--------
* A GSLB (Global Site Load Balancer) at the most simplistic level is a health
  checking DNS server.
* Most often used to load balance between geographically dispersed data centers.
* Generally has health check mechanisms similar to load balancers which are used
  to return an IP address (as part of the DNS lookup) of a host that is currently
  available to service the request.
* Conceptually provides coarse-grained round robin and affinity balancing
  algorithms by setting the time to live (TTL) of the DNS lookup for an
  appropriate duration.

CDN's
-----

(cparedes: I'd argue that it's valid in some contexts, depending on what
you're load balancing)
