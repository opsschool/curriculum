Ops School is a community driven effort, and we always need people to
contribute.
Currently we need people who are able to fill in areas in our documentation -
whether it's a little or a lot, everything helps.

***********************
How we'll organize work
***********************

This is a living document. We write headings and their breakdowns as bullet
points. We turn each bullet point into the material we want people to read.
That's right. The syllabus IS the course. For now, at least, until we find
a better way.

You should start writing the actual material to be taught right into this
syllabus. We'll worry about formatting and things later.
As you write, remember that "101" material is aimed at people who are working up
to being junior sysadmins. They're mostly blank slates.


*****************
How to contribute
*****************

You can find the documentation source on GitHub and send pull requests:

  https://github.com/opsschool/curriculum

Please fork the repo to your own account, create a branch, make your changes
there, and issue a pull request from your fork/branch to ``opsschool:master``.
Be descriptive in your commit message for anything non-obvious.

If all of this git and GitHub stuff is a little overwhelming, take a
look at `GitHub's documentation`_. If you have still have questions
after reading that, please feel free to join #opsschool on
irc.freenode.net and ask your questions there. We'll be glad to help you
get your patches merged--but please remember that many of us are busy ops
professionals, so we may not respond immediately.

*****************
Ops School Videos
*****************

In collaboration with O'Reilly Media, we are filming the Ops School curriculum
to provide another method of learning for students. Filming happens
approximately every 3 months in New York or Silicon Valley.

O'Reilly is publishing the videos online, in individual form and in package
form. Any profits which would be made by Ops School are donated to non-profit
organisations which aid in learning for low-income persons.

Video can be short (10-20 mins), or longer. Depending on the content in the
video, some presenters choose to use slides, while others prefer screen-casting
live demonstrations. Some videos may not need any supporting material at all!

The next scheduled filming is at the Santa Clara Hyatt, from Monday June 17th
2013 to Friday June 21st 2013. Filming slots are available all day.

The topics which have already been filmed are:

* Boot Process 101
* DNS 101
* Filesystems 101
* MySQL 101
* Nagios 101
* Networking 101
* Outage Investigation 101
* Package Management 101
* Shells 101
* SSH 101
* Application Level Monitoring
* Careers In Operations
* Operable Service - What People Expect From an Operable Service
* Productivity Tools and Techniques
* The ``/proc`` Filesystem
* Web Flow - The Life of a Web Request

If you are interested in filming, please contact Avleen Vig (avleen#gmail.com)
or open an issue on the Github project.

How to write sections
*********************

In order to help students learn as much as possible, we are taking the following
approach to the curriculum (this isn't a hard-and-fast rule, but an encouraged
guideline wherever possible):

* Approach your writing in three steps:

  #. Tell students what they're going to learn
  #. Teach them what they need to know
  #. Tell them what they have learnt

* As much as possible, treat this as an interactive exercise. For example if you
  are writing about virtual machines, don't just write about virtual machines.
  Have the student create a virtual machine, and then explain what just
  happened.
  Don't tell students that package managers install packages, have them install
  a few packages and then explain how the package manager did its thing.

Please read the :ref:`conventions` topic for some style guideline and preferences.

****************************
Overwriting existing content
****************************

There are times when you will want to update or replace sections of text written
by others. When doing so, follow these guidelines to ensure your changes are
integrated smoothly:

* Submit your pull request
* Reference the original author in your commit

We'll wait a few days (up to one week) to let the original author comment, if we
feel there may be anything contentious in the commit. For most simple and
straightforward commits, we'll simply accept the commit.
