Ops School is a community driven effort, and we always need people to
contribute.
Currently we need people who are able to fill in areas in our documentation -
whether it's a little or a lot, everything helps.

***********************
How we'll organize work
***********************

This is a living document. We write headings and their breakdowns as bullet
points. We turn each bullet point into the material we want people to read.
That's right. The syllabus IS the course. For now, at least, until we find
a better way.

You should start writing the actual material to be taught right into this
syllabus. We'll worry about formatting and things later.
As you write, remember that "101" material is aimed at people who are working up
to being junior sysadmins. They're mostly blank slates.


*****************
How to contribute
*****************

You can find the documentation source on Github and send pull requests:

Please fork the repo to your own account, create a branch, make your changes
there, and issue a pull request from your fork/branch to ``opsschool:master``.
Be descriptive in your commit message for anything non-obvious.

*********************
How to write sections
*********************

In order to help students learn as much as possible, we are taking the following
approach to the curriculum (this isn't a hard-and-fast rule, but an encouraged
guideline wherever possible):

* Approach your writing in three steps:

  #. Tell students what they're going to learn
  #. Teach them what they need to know
  #. Tell them what they have learnt

* As much as possible, treat this as an interactive exercise. For example if you
  are writing about virtual machines, don't just write about virtual machines.
  Have the student create a virtual machine, and then explain what just
  happened.
  Don't tell students that package managers install packages, have them install
  a few packages and then explain how the package manager did its thing.
