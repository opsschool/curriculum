.. todo:: Explain "What is Ops School?"


***************
Goals and Focus
***************

To have a complete syllabus for training smart persons with high potential who
already have a basic understanding of Linux or other UNIX variant, to become
strong junior systems administrators. This course will focus on the Linux
platform as a basis for competency in any UNIX ecosystem.

Usenix defines the sysadmin role as:

.. epigraph::
   Familiarity with an operating system and its commands/utilities at a user
   level; ability to edit files, use basic utilities and commands, find users'
   home directories, navigate through the file system, install software on
   workstations, and use I/O redirection; some understanding of how user
   authentication happens in a directory service context. Ability to
   identify/locate shared resources and perform simple tasks (e.g., manipulate
   jobs in a print queue, figure out why a network file system isn't
   available).

   -- Usenix, *Job Descriptions for System Administrators, 3d Edition Revised*

Our goal is to teach these topics, but also to provide a good understanding of
how the components work, which enables the students to continue to grow their
skills and contributions.

Our focus is any person who has an interest in operations. There are often
personality traits which allow people to understand the role of a systems
administrator more easily, but the material should be easily accessible to
anybody who wishes to learn about it.

The required minimum skill level before participating will be as follows:

* Has installed Linux or other UNIX variant
* Is comfortable with, or even prefers, working on the command line
* Has a basic understanding on navigating the filesystem, and the most basic
  tools (ps, ls, top, etc).

***************
Syllabus layout
***************

As we create this syllabus, there will inevitably be items which are found to be
too advanced for a first pass but should be kept and taught as a progression
into an intermediate systems administrator.

* Junior topics are labelled "101".
* Intermediate topics are labelled "201".
* Senior topics are labelled "301".
