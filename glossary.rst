    BIOS
        A set of computer instructions in firmware that control input and
        output operations.

    CLI
        Command Line Interface

    Domain Specific Language
        A special purpose programming language dedicated to a particular
        problem area, e.g. SQL is a domain specific language for retrieval
        of data from a database.

    EPEL
        Common acronym for Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux. These are
        typically included in Fedora Linux, and provided for RedHat, CentOS,
        and other RPM-based distributions. The project's homepage is
        here: `FedoraProject:EPEL <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_.

    GUI
        Pronounced "gooey", this is an acronym for a Graphical User Interface.
        This is distinctly different from a :term:`CLI`, in that the GUI typically can contain more complex visual interactions.

    MAC
        Pronounced as "mack" and often used as a noun referring to a network
        device's Media Access Controller (MAC) address. A MAC address is a
        globally unique number assigned to each interface in an Ethernet network
        and used to direct Ethernet frames between source and destination
        devices.

    OSI
        Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is an effort to develop
        standards-based computer networking protocols in order to allow
        networking equipment from different vendors to interoperate without
        relying on implementation of competing proprietary protocols. The OSI is
        best known for the development of the standard seven-layer OSI model for
        describing layers of abstraction into which the various networking
        protocols are categorized.

    POSIX
        An acronym for "Portable Operating System Interface", is a family of
        standards specified by the IEEE for maintaining compatibility between
        operating systems. POSIX defines the application programming interface
        (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for
        software compatibility with variants of Unix and other operating systems.

    RFC
        The RFC documents (Request for Comments) are a series of Internet
        standards, best common practices, and related documents describing how
        networked computers communicate. This document series provides the
        standards for how the Internet and many other related technologies
        interrelate and interoperate.
