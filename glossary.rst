    OSI
        Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is an effort to develop
        standards-based computer networking protocols in order to allow
        networking equipment from different vendors to interoperate without
        relying on implementation of competing proprietary protocols. The OSI is
        best known for the development of the standard seven-layer OSI model for
        describing layers of abstraction into which the various networking
        protocols are categorized.
