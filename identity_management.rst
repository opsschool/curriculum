LDAP
====

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an application protocol used for accessing and maintaining directory services. Directory Services uses a database-styled system to correlate information about objects in that directory with metadata about that object.

Directory services provide information about a unique ID, in much the same way that an ISBN number identifies a book in a library. That unique ID can be a user, a computer, or a group, or any number of other objects, depending on how the directory index (or schema, as it's referred to) has been specified.

The metadata for that object can include things such as a Display Name, Address, Date Created, Date Modified, Home Directory, etc...
