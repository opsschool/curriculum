VLANs, 802.1q tagging
=====================
Sometimes it is advantageous to break up a single Layer 2 broadcast domain into
multiple Layer 2 broadcast domains. As we had previously discussed, Layer 2 is
addressed by MAC addresses, which are flat address space (non-routable)
constructs; this creates a Layer 2 broadcast domain, also called a "segment" or
"LAN" (local area network.) You can then map one or more IP networks (Layer 3
addressing) onto a Layer 2 segment. If you map more than one Layer 3 network to
a segment, you can get into some headaches, such as having to address multiple
IP addr's on various host and router interfaces (one for each network) with the
attendant confusion, and also that broadcasts produced by each IP network (i.e.
ARP requests) multiply, and bandwidth is consumed. Therefore, most networking
professionals agree that it's best to only map one IP network to one Layer 2
segment.

So, if multiple Layer 3 networks need to be used, instead of using multiple
switches for each Layer 2 segment, it is possible to divide a single VLAN-
capable switch into two or more "virtual" switches. This is possible due to the
concept of :term:`VLAN`, which stands for "Virtual LAN".

To communicate between the Layer 3 networks mapped to their individual VLANs,
packets need to pass through a router or other Layer 3 device. If one has a
switch with many VLANs implemented on it, either of these two methods could work:

1. Devote a switch (and respective router) interface per VLAN, with a single link for
   each VLAN. This is the simplest method, but the most wasteful of (expensive) switch and
   router interfaces.

2. "Trunk" multiple VLANs over one physical link, which only requires a single interface
   per side (switch to router, or server to switch.) This method multiplexes multiple
   VLANs over the one link by "tagging" the frame with a 4-byte VLAN identifier field
   which is inserted after the destination MAC field in the Ethernet header. This tagging
   format is officially defined by the IEEE's 802.1q protocol. The tag field insertion
   happens at the sending trunk interface (which is a part of the sending station's VLAN),
   and the tag is stripped of by the receiving trunk interface, and the frame placed on
   the proper VLAN on the receiving device.

The VLAN identifier must be between 1 and 4094 inclusive. The 802.1q tag also
provides for a 3-bit priority field and 1-bit discard eligibility field which
can be used for QoS applications. The trunking and priority functions of 802.1q
can be enabled and disabled separately.

Spanning Tree
=============
As networks and broadcast domains grow and become more complex, it becomes much easier to
intentionally or unintentionally create loops- multiple network paths between one or
more switches. These loops may lead to a infinite forwarding of Ethernet packets, causing
switches to be overwhelmed by an ever-increasing amount of packets being forwarded to all
other switches in the broadcast domain. To address this concern, Spanning Tree Protocol
(STP) was invented as a standard protocol used by Ethernet switches, designed to prevent
such loops in broadcast domains.

To disable loops, each switch that implements Spanning Tree Protocol (STP / IEEE 802.1D) will
participate in electing a "root" device where the Spanning Tree is calculated from. Once
the root is chosen, all other participating switches will calculate their least-cost path
for each of its ports to the root device. This is usually a port that traverses the least
number of segments between the source and the root. Once each device has chosen its least-cost
port, or Root Port (RP), it calculates the least-cost path for each network segment. By
doing this, each switch obtains a Designated Port (DP), or a port on which it should expect
to accept traffic to forward through its RP. Upon calculating these values, all other paths
to the root device are disabled- marking them as Blocked Ports (BP).

A major benefit to using STP to prevent network loops is that network administrators can
intentionally connect redundant paths for fault tollerance without worry of causing an infinite
loop during normal operation. Should a path in a broadcast domain fail, each participating
switch will recalculate the DP and RP, modifying the status of BPs if necessary. This has the
effect of repairing the broken path by routing traffic through segments around the failure.

IOS switch configuration
========================

Cisco devices use a command line-based configuration interface which can be
accessed via RS-232, Telnet or SSH. The command line syntax is distinctive and
has been loosely copied by many other vendors, so some familiarity with the
Cisco-style configuration can go a long way.

When connecting via RS-232, use 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity,
no flow control.

You can abbreviate keywords on the command line without having to press Tab, so
long as they are unambiguous. You can also use Tab as you would in a UNIX
shell.

While using the command line, you can type '?' at any time and receive
context-sensitive help.

The command line is mode-based. The prompt tells you of your current mode.
Awareness of your current mode is key to efficient operation of the command
line. Here are some examples:

=========================  ===================================================
Prompt                     Meaning
=========================  ===================================================
``hostname>``              'EXEC' mode, non-privileged access
                           (like ``$`` on Linux)
``hostname#``              'EXEC' mode, privileged access
                           (like ``#`` on Linux)
``hostname(config)#``      Global configuration mode
``hostname(config-if)#``   Interface configuration mode
=========================  ===================================================

EXEC mode allows you to execute imperative commands such as ``ping``.
The configuration mode allows you to add and remove configuration statements.

The following commands move you between modes:

=========================  ======  ===========================================
Command                    Mode    Effect
=========================  ======  ===========================================
``enable``                 EXEC    Become privileged (like ``su`` on Linux)
``conf t``                 EXEC    Enter ``(config)`` mode.
``int <interface>``        config  Enter ``(config-if)`` mode for an
                                   interface.
``exit``                   Any     Leave the current mode or logout.
=========================  ======  ===========================================

Other useful commands include:

=========================  ======  ===========================================
Command                    Mode    Effect
=========================  ======  ===========================================
``show ...``               EXEC    The subcommands of this command provide
                                   access to all available information.
``show run``               EXEC    Show the current configuration.
``show ip int brief``      EXEC    Show all interface names, IPv4 addresses,
                                   and their status.
``wr``                     EXEC    Save the current configuration.
``ping <host>``            EXEC    Ping. '!' means a response,
                                   '.' means a timeout.
``no <command>``           config  Delete a configuration statement in config
                                   mode.
``do <command>``           config  Execute a command in EXEC mode from config
                                   mode.
=========================  ======  ===========================================

Note that configuration changes become active as soon as they are made. The
``show run`` command shows the configuration which is currently in effect. This
is not saved until you execute ``wr``.
