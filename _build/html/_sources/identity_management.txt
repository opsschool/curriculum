LDAP
====

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an application protocol used for
accessing and maintaining directory services. Directory Services uses a
database-styled system to correlate information about objects in that directory
with metadata about that object.

Directory services provide information about a unique ID, in much the same way
that an ISBN number identifies a book in a library. That unique ID can be a
user, a computer, or a group, or any number of other objects, depending on how
the directory index (or schema, as it is referred to) has been specified.

The metadata for that object can include things such as a Display Name, Address,
Date Created, Date Modified, Home Directory, etc... Since LDAP can be extended
by modifying or adding to the schema, it is a very flexible format and serves as
the base of most modern directory services.


Active Directory
----------------

Active Directory is Microsoft's implementation of LDAP, coupled with Kerberos_
encrypted authentication
security. One benefit of Active Directory is `Group Policy`_, which is a flexible and
granular system for controlling a great many user and computer settings based on
flexible criteria, such as Organizational Unit or Group membership.

Active Directory works best with Windows Domain Controllers serving as both DHCP
and DNS servers, in an AD-integrated DNS zone. While DNS or DHCP can be handled
by alternative systems such as BIND, this is an advanced configuration, and
should not be attempted in most scenarios.

The Active Directory schema has been modified with each release of Windows
Server, and will often be modified when deploying core Microsoft server
applications such as Exchange or Certificate Services. The overall state of the
domain is referred to as the `Domain Functional Level`_ - this may require consideration
when determining requirements of a project or feature implementation.

Active Directory is typically managed through a variety of tools, including:

GUI Tools

* Active Directory Users & Computers (to manage the users, computers,
  and groups in a domain)
* Active Directory Sites & Services (to manage the
  replication of AD to different sites/servers)
* adsiedit (a useful tool for viewing the attributes of objects within the domain)

Command Line Tools 

* Powershell - through the Active Directory cmdlets
* ldp - an extremely low-level tool for interacting with LDAP directly, not 
  recommended for most uses
