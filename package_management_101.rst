What is a package manager?
==========================
High level overview.
Mention that most flavours of Unix have their own way of managing packages, but
at their core they all follow the similar principles (install/uninstall
packages, keep track of what is installed, etc).

RPM and YUM (RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, Scientific Linux)
===========================================================
Some text about what RPM is, what YUM is, and how they both provide two halfs of
the same function.

Installing packages
-------------------

Upgrading packages
------------------

Uninstalling packages
---------------------

Querying the RPM database
-------------------------

Creating packages
-----------------
Mention spec files and roughly how RPMs are put together.
Then introduce FPM and tell them not to bother with spec files yet.
