#####################

Welcome to the Ops School curriculum documentation site.

Ops School is a comprehensive program that will help you learn to be an
operations engineer.
Operations engineers are highly skilled people who manage the computer systems
of businesses big and small. In addition to corporate systems, operations
engineers also maintain the systems that allow websites, networks, payments
systems and other Internet services to function.
The field of operations engineering covers a wide variety of topics, from systems
administration, to security, networking and beyond. Ops School will guide you
through all of these skill sets from beginner to expert.

Since the early 90's, operations engineers have been in high demand. As a
result, these positions often offer high salaries and long term job security.
The `SAGE/LISA Salary Survey <https://www.usenix.org/lisa/salary-surveys>`_ has
charted the average salaries for systems administrators and operations engineers
since 1999 and has consistently shown the field to be prosperous for those
people who enjoy diving into the inner workings of computer systems.

If you already know about the profession and want to know how to start, read
:ref:`How to become an operations engineer <how-to-become-an-operations-engineer>`.

If you're reading about this career for the first time and want to know if it is
