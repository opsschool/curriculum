#####################

Welcome to the Ops School curriculum documentation site.

Ops School is a comprehensive program that will help you learn to be an operations engineer.
Operations engineers are highly skilled people who manage the computer systems of businesses big and small.
In addition to corporate systems, operations engineers also maintain the systems that allow websites, networks, payments systems and other Internet services to function.
The field of operations engineering covers a wide variety of topics, from systems administration, to security, networking and beyond.
Ops School will guide you through all of these skill sets from beginner to expert.

Since the early 90's, operations engineers have been in high demand.
As a result, these positions often offer high salaries and long term job security.
The `SAGE/LISA Salary Survey <https://www.usenix.org/lisa/salary-surveys>`_ has charted the average salaries for systems administrators and operations engineers
since 1999 and has consistently shown the field to be prosperous for those people who enjoy diving into the inner workings of computer systems.
