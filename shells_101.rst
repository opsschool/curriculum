Shells

What is a shell?
================
A [Li|U]nix shell is the command-line interface between the user and the system.
It is used to perform some action, specifically, typing commands and displaying
output, requested by the user.

Introduction to Bash
====================
**Bash** is known as the Bourne-again shell, written by Brian Fox, and is a play
on the name of the previously named Bourne shell (/bin/sh) written by Steve
Bourne. [#f1]_

Shell Fundamentals
==================

Command-line Editing Modes
--------------------------
Over time, as one progresses with using the shell, it will become necessary to execute
commands that may contain many arguments or have output piped to other commands.  Beyond 
simple commands such as ``cat`` and ``ls``, it can be tedious should one need to re-type,
or, in most cases, edit, a given command.  Luckily, ``bash`` provides a facility to make
this scenario easier: the command-line editing mode.

The command-line editing mode emulates the movement functions of two common text editors,
``emacs`` and ``vi``.  In the case of the shell, the cursor's movement is being controlled.
Tighten up the above sentence.  It's wordy and doesn't seem to make the point I want it to make. 

By default, ``bash`` operates in ``emacs`` mode.

Example Edit Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following commands are very common while using the ``emacs`` mode.

- ``Ctrl-b``: Move backward by one character
- ``Ctrl-f``: Move forward by one character
- ``Ctrl-a``: Move to the beginning of the line
- ``Ctrl-e``: Move to the end of the line
- ``Ctrl-k``: Delete from the cursor forward
- ``Ctrl-u``: Delete from the cursor backward
- ``Ctrl-r``: Search the command history

.. todo: Add vi examples. I haven't used that mode in years and will need to look up the mirror version of the above commands.

Setting the Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One can manually set the desired mode using the below commands.

- ``emacs``

  ``set -o emacs``

- ``vi``

  ``set -o vi``

See :doc:`text_editing_101` for details on appropriate edit commands to use on
the command line.

Environment variables
---------------------
Environment variables are used to define values for often-used attributes of a
user's shell. In total, these variables define the user's environment. Some
environment variables provide a simple value describing some basic attribute,
such the user's current directory (``$PWD``). Others define the behavior of a
command, such as whether or not the ``history`` command should log repeated
commands individually or log the repeated command once (``$HISTCONTROL``).

$PATH
~~~~~
The most common, or most recognized, environment variable is the ``$PATH``
variable. It defines the set of directories that the shell can search to find a
command. Without an explicit path provided when calling a command (i.e. ``/bin/ps``),
the shell will search the directories listed in the ``$PATH`` variable until it
finds the command. If the command is not found in any of the defined directories
in ``$PATH``, the shell will produce an error explaining as much. ::

  $ foobar -V
  -bash: foobar: command not found


To view the contents of the ``$PATH`` variable, use ``echo`` to print the variable's value: ::

  $ echo $PATH
  /usr/local/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

The order of the directories in the ``$PATH`` variable, from left to right, is
important; when searching directories for a command, the shell will stop looking
after it finds its first match.
In other words, using our example ``$PATH`` variable above, if there is a
version of ``ps`` that exists in ``/usr/local/bin`` that is preferred (by the sysadmin)
over the version that exists in ``/bin``, the shell will still execute ``/bin/ps``
due to the precedence of the directories defined in the ``$PATH`` variable.

To list all of the shell's environment variables, use the ``env`` command: ::

  $ env
  HOSTNAME=foobar
  SHELL=/bin/bash
  TERM=xterm
  HISTSIZE=1000
  USER=root
  PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/root/bin:/usr/local/bin
  MAIL=/var/spool/mail/root
  PWD=/root/curriculum
  PS1=[\[\e[33;1m\]\t \[\e[31;1m\]\u\[\e[0m\]@\[\e[31;1m\]\h\[\e[0m\] \W\[\e[0m\]]# 
  HISTCONTROL=ignoredups
  SHLVL=1
  SUDO_COMMAND=/bin/bash
  HOME=/root
  HISTTIMEFORMAT=[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S] 
  OLDPWD=/tmp

Shell Profiles
--------------
Shell profiles are used to define a user's environment.  In cases where an environment variable
needs to be set or a script needs to be run at login, a profile can be used to ensure this
happens consistently and automatically.  Anything that can be run in a standalone shell
script can be placed in a profile.

There are two types of profiles:

- Global profile (``/etc/profile``)
- User profile (``~/.bash_profile``)

``/etc/profile``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the global profile.  Any environment variable set in this file applies to all users.
Any script called from this file is executed for all users.

``~/.bash_profile``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the user profile.  Any environment variable set in this file applies to the user only.
Any script called from this file is executed for the user only.

Profile Precedence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**NOTE**: It is possible to override settings from ``/etc/profile`` via ``~/.bash_profile`` as ``~/.bash_profile``
is executed after ``/etc/profile``.

Special Environment Variables
-----------------------------
Certain variables exist that provide useful information about what is happening in the environment.
For example, it may be necessary to know the ID of a running process or the exit status of an executed command.

Process ID: ``$$``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To determine the process ID (PID) of the current shell, first run ``ps`` to find the PID, then run ``echo $$``
to confirm the PID. ::

  $ ps -efl | grep bash
   502 20440 20439   0 10:25PM ttys001    0:00.01 -bash                4006  31  0  2433436   1228 -      S                   0
   502 20447 20440   0 10:29PM ttys001    0:00.00 grep bash            4006  31  0  2432768    620 -      R+                  0
  $ echo $$
  20440

Background Process ID: ``$!``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Occasionally, commands will need to be executed in the background (via the ``&`` operator).  The PID of that process
can be found using the ``$!`` variable.  For example, call ``sleep`` for 30 seconds and place it in the background.
Then ``echo $!`` to see the PID.  Alternatively, call ``ps`` to confirm the PID. ::

  $ sleep 30 &
  [1] 20450
  $ echo $!
  20450
  $ ps -efl | grep sleep
  502 20450 20440   0 10:33PM ttys001    0:00.00 sleep 30             4006  31  0  2432748    496 -      S                   0

Exit Status: ``$?``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When a command is executed, it always has an exit status.  That status defines whether or not the command was successful.
For success, the exit status is **0**.  Non-zero values denote failure.  Many commands provide multiple exit codes to help
define what the reason for failure was.  This helps the user troubleshoot any problems.

As an example, try to list a known file within a user's home directory, then list a file that is known **not** to exist.
After each command, execute ``echo $?`` to see the exit status. ::

  $ ls .bash_profile
  .bash_profile
  $ echo $?
  0
  $ ls foobar
  ls: foobar: No such file or directory
  $ echo $?
  1


History
-------
The history is a handy facility within ``bash``; it stores all of the commands that the user has executed.

To see the history, simply type ``history`` and all of the stored commands will be displayed to the terminal.
Similarily, run ``cat ~/.bash_history`` to see all stored commands.

Re-executing Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A benefit of storing command history is that the commands can be easily recalled.  To execute the last command,
type ``!!``: ::

  $ ls
  file1 file2 dir1
  $ !!
  ls
  file1 file2 dir1

Note that the last command is echoed just above the output of that command.

To execute the nth command in history, run ``!n`` where ``n`` is the line number of the command as found in the 
output of ``history``: ::

  $ history | less
    1  ls -la
    2  ls -F
    3  pwd
  $ !2
  ls -F
  file1 file2 dir1/

Searching History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Finally, one can search the history by typing ``Ctlr-r`` followed by a string to match a command: ::

  $ (reverse-i-search)`ls': ls -F

To execute the command (if a match is found), simply type Enter.

Job control
-----------
From time to time, it may be necessary to manage commands running in the background.  These are typically referred to as jobs.
A command can be placed in the background via the ``&`` operator.  Use the ``jobs`` command to see the job in the background.
To bring it back to the foreground, run ``fg``: ::

  [23:24:22 ~]$ sleep 30 &
  [1] 20969
  [23:24:26 ~]$ jobs
  [1]+  Running                 sleep 30 &
  [23:24:29 ~]$ fg
  sleep 30
  [23:24:56 ~]$

While in the foreground, the job can be suspended via ``Ctrl-z`` and sent to the background once more using ``bg``: ::

  [23:24:56  ~]$ sleep 30 &
  [1] 21078
  [23:28:25  ~]$ jobs
  [1]+  Running                 sleep 30 &
  [23:28:27  ~]$ fg
  sleep 30
  ^Z
  [1]+  Stopped                 sleep 30
  [23:28:33  ~]$ bg
  [1]+ sleep 30 &
  [23:28:37  ~]$ jobs
  [1]+  Running                 sleep 30 &
  [23:29:39 ~ ]$ jobs
  [1]+  Done                    sleep 30

Multiple Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to have multiple jobs running in the background at the same time.  Use the ``jobs`` command to track them
via their job ID, noted between the square brackets after sending a job to the background. Knowing the job ID is helpful in
the event that the job needs to be pulled into the foreground (via ``fg``) or if the job needs to be killed: ::

  [23:36:01  ~]$ sleep 120 &
  [1] 21086
  [23:36:16  ~]$ sleep 240 &
  [2] 21087
  [23:36:20  ~]$ jobs
  [1]-  Running                 sleep 120 &
  [2]+  Running                 sleep 240 &
  [23:36:21  ~]$ fg %1
  sleep 120
  ^C
  [23:36:33  ~]$ jobs
  [2]+  Running                 sleep 240 &
  [23:36:35  ~]$ kill %2
  [23:36:39  ~]$ jobs
  [2]+  Terminated: 15          sleep 240

**NOTE**: When manipulating jobs with any command, the jobs are described by their ID using the ``%n`` notation 
where ``n`` is the job ID.

For information on ensuring running jobs continue, even when terminal
connectivity is lost, see the sections on :ref:`gnu-screen` and :ref:`tmux`.
