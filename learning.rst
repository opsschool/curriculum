Learning and strategies for improvement
=======================================

Explicit vs Tacit knowledge
---------------------------

*Explicit knowledge* can be defined as that gained from books or listening to a
lecture. Basically some form of reading or auditory resource. It is typically
easy to transfer to others, an example would be a manual for driving and
operating a car.

*Tacit knowledge* can be defined and describes as that gained from experience,
action and practice. It is typically difficult to transfer this type of
knowledge to other people. A good example would be flying a plane.

Let's start off by making a distinction between different types of knowledge.
The practice of system administration relies heavily on both types of learning
so just one type of experience is not enough to be great in this field.
Essentially, the two knowledge types work hand in hand. So for example, reading
a ton of books, while useful in its own right will not be nearly as effective
as reading books and then applying the knowledge gained from hands on
experience. Likewise, if somebody never bothers to pickup a book and relies
entirely on hands experiences they will not be as knowledgeable as someone who
incorporates both types of knowledge. It is in the opinion of many in the field
that much more can be learned from hands on experience than by books alone.

Types of learning
-----------------

There has been a good deal of research done on this subject but for the purposes
of this post I would like to boil this all down to what are considered the three
primary or main styles of learning. Types of learning play an important role
because they work hand in hand with explicit and tacit knowledge. Each one of
these different styles represents a different sort of idiom to the learning
experience. So here they are:

* Visual
* Auditory
* Kinesthetic

It can be argued that employing a good variety of learning and study methods
would be the most appropriate way to develop your skills as a sysadmin or any
other career related in the operations field. Instead of saying
that one is better than another, one should employ all of these
types learning in their own life.  Take a look at yourself and
figure out how you learn best and then decide which method(s) are
the most and least helpful and then decide how to make these styles
work to your advantage.

For example, having a piece of reading material as a reference or as an
introduction is great. If the subject material is difficult and isn't easily
understood, a good next step to take is internalizing things by listening to or
watching others. Finally, with a good enough understanding about a topic,
quickly put things into your own experiences. It is much more easy to remember
things when you are able to experience them yourself.

Learning strategies
-------------------

It is important to highlight some of the major tactics that can be utilized when
attempting to learn a new subject. Here are some different strategies and
techniques for learning new and difficult to understand information. Many of
these strategies work together or in tandem so they may described more than
once.

**The Feynman technique** – This is as close to the end all be all that there is
when it comes to learning. Everybody is probably familiar with this one, but am
guessing the name is unfamiliar. This technique is used to explain or go
through a topic as if you were teaching it to somebody else that was just
learning about it for the first time. This basically forces you to know what
you’re talking about. If you get stuck when trying to explain a particular
concept or idea, make a note of what you are struggling with and research and
relearn the material until you can confidently explain it. You should be able
to explain the subject simply, if your explanations are wordy or convoluted you
probably don’t understand it as well as you think.

**Reading** – This is a great technique to get an introduction to a topic by
reading up on (and bookmarking) what information you feel to be the most
important, whether it be official documentation, RFC’s, books, magazines,
respected blogs and authors, etc. It is a good idea to take very brief notes
when something looks like it would useful so to try it out yourself.

**Watching/Listening to others** – After getting a good idea from reading about
a subject it is good to reinforce this by either watching demonstrations,
videos, listening to podcasts, lectures or anything else that will show how to
get a better idea of how to do something. An example of this would be to put on
a podcast. It kills time as well as improves knowledge at the cost of nothing.
Very efficient! The same with videos and demonstrations, the only thing holding
you back is the motivation.

**Try things for yourself** – Sometimes this can be the most difficult approach
but definitely can also be the most rewarding, there is nothing better than
learning things the hard way. Try things out for yourself in a lab or anywhere
that you can practice the concepts that you are attempting to learn and
understand.

**Take notes** – This is important for your own understanding of how things
work in a way that you can internalize. Take notes on simple things like
commands you know you won’t remember, related topics and concepts or even just
jotting down keywords quickly to Google for later on. This goes hand in hand
with the reading technique described above, just jotting down very simple,
brief notes can be really useful.

**Communicate with others** - There are plenty of resources out there for
getting help and for communicating and discussing what you learn with others.
/r/sysadmin would be a good starting point. IRC channels are another great
place to ask questions and get help, there are channels for pretty much any
subject you can think of out there. There are good sysadmin related channels at
irc.freenode.net, if you don’t already utilize IRC, take a look.

**Come back later** – Give your brain some time to start digesting some of the
information and to take a step back and put the pieces together to begin
creating a bigger picture. If you have been working on learning a new concept
or subject and felt overwhelmed and feel stuck, take a break. Do something
completely different or think about something else entirely and came back to
the subject later on with a fresh perspective. Sometimes these difficult
subjects just take time to fully understand so taking breaks and clearing your
head can be very useful.

**Sleep on it** – Have you ever heard of the term before? This may sound crazy
but sometimes if there is a particular problem that you're struggling with,
think about it before going to sleep. By blocking out all outside interference
and noise it is much easier think about, come up with fresh perspectives and
ideas and often times you will wake up with an answer the next morning.

**Break stuff** – One of the best ways to incorporate a number of these
techniques is to intentionally break stuff in your own setups. Triple check to
be sure that nothing important will get broken first and then go ahead and give
it a try. A much deeper and more intimate relationship with the way things work, why they
work and how they get broken occurs when things get broken. The great thing about
using this method is that it is almost always useful for something in the future,
whether it be the troubleshooting skills, the Googling skills or the specific
knowledge in the particular area that needed to be fixed.

**Practice, practice, practice** – There is just no way around it.To get
better at something one must dedicate time and be prepared to practice like an
absolute maniac. For operations roles and system administration
this can partially come from practical job experience but it also
comes from dedicated study and lab time. The hands on component is
where most experience and time will come from and becoming better
doesn’t just happen, it takes cultivation and time, just like with
any other skill. Stick with it and never stop learning and improving
on your skillset through practice and experience.

Things to keep in mind as you learn how to be an engineer
=========================================================

General Tips for improvement
----------------------------

These simple tips can go a really long way. There is no magical instant way to
improve yourself. If you take nothing else, just remember the following. The
best way to see results and really work on yourself starts by changing your
habits, working hard and being consistent.That might not be what you are
looking for, but it has been proven to be true time and again that
even by making just these few adjustments can go a long way in
becoming better at what you do.

**Exercise** - Just doing a Google search will reveal all the
information on the massive benefits of proper exercise. Even just
this one tip can make a huge difference in the way you think and
feel. It is not recommended to completely change the way you live
your life when starting out, especially if you are sedentary. Just
make a simple change as something to start with and work from there.
There are many benefits of exercising and working your body regularly
will help you improve your mind.

**Sleep** - This is probably the most important thing to remember when you are
trying to work on hacking your mind and improving yourself. 8 hours of sleep
seems to be the general rule of thumb, and it should not be overlooked when you
are evaluating yourself and your goals for getting to where you want to be. If
you want to wake up early, you need to go to sleep early, it really is as simple
as that. It is also important to be consistent on your sleep schedule so your
body can get used to when it should slow down and when it should speed up (even
on weekends!). For example, getting in a routine of winding down at a certain
time, say 9 pm every night by reading a book for an hour to train your body
that it is time to sleep. Read until say 10 pm every night if you want to wake
up at 6 am to get the sleep consistency your body needs, also giving your body
enough time to repair and heal itself to get up and going.

**Diet** - Also important. Everybody is different so please take this advice at
face value. As with anything else, it is not recommended to go all out and
make completely polar changes to every eating habit at once. You will crash
and burn like many others.So while it may work for some you generally will be
safer and more likely to make a lasting impact if you take things slowly. Work
on one thing at a time and gradually make the changes to improve your diet and
health. As an example, start by cutting out something small, like cutting out
a particular type of food that isn’t exactly healthy. Not entirely, but even
just cutting back is a good first step. Basically doing something is better
than doing nothing.
